I've always been interested in the intersection of technology and design, and on creating software which is built with real human workflows in mind, software as a means to an end of allowing people to solve bigger problems and do more. Since then, I've worked at Capital One, Microsoft, and most recently at Audible trying to solve problems at an enterprise scale."
